# Full card description/meaning
prompt: A massive mechanical wheel rotates in a polluted sky, its surface etched with algorithmic symbols and corrupted data streams. A cybernetic sphinx with glowing optical sensors perches atop wielding an energy blade, while a bio-mechanical serpent descends on one side and a digital manifestation of Anubis rises on the other. The wheel represents the eternal cycle of technological fortune, digital karma, and the constant dance between system upgrades and obsolescence in the connected world.
