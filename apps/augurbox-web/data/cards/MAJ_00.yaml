# Full card description/meaning
prompt: A young Drifter in ill-fitting salvaged gear stands at the edge of a massive scrapyard, holding a worn datapad containing basic survival protocols and a small bundle of personal possessions. Their environmental suit is patched and clearly second-hand, but their eyes show determination rather than fear. In the distance, other Drifters work among towering piles of alien technology and twisted metal. The scene represents the first tentative steps into the harsh Fringe, the courage to leave safety behind, and the unlimited potential that comes with embracing the unknown frontier.
