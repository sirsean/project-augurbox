# Full card description/meaning
prompt: A magnificent alien plant unfurls its golden petals across a previously barren landscape, its bio-luminescent flowers releasing spores that shimmer like liquid sunlight in the atmosphere. Where the spores settle, the dead soil comes alive with new growth, while the air itself seems to sparkle with renewed vitality and possibility. A young Drifter stands in wonder beneath the towering bloom, their arms raised in celebration as the life-giving particles swirl around them like living stars. Other colonists emerge from their shelters to witness this miraculous transformation, their faces filled with joy and hope as they realize their world is being reborn. The Aurelian Bloom towers above them all, its light driving away the shadows and filling everyone present with an profound sense of connection to the life force that flows through all things. The scene represents pure joy and vitality, the success that comes from harmony with natural forces, and the miraculous transformation that occurs when life finds a way to flourish against all odds.
