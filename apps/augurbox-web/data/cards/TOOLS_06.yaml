# Full card description/meaning
prompt: A triumphant engineer rides a reinforced construction mech through a crowd of celebrating Drifters and Guild members, wearing a crown made from welded salvage and holding a gleaming power drill topped with a wreath of twisted metal. Five other workers raise their tools—wrenches, plasma cutters, diagnostic scanners—in recognition of the successful completion of a major infrastructure project. The scene represents victory through skilled labor, public recognition of engineering excellence, and the respect earned through masterful craftsmanship in the harsh Fringe environment.
