# Full card description/meaning
prompt: "An ancient artificial intelligence awakens in the depths of a long-buried alien facility, its crystalline core pulsing with otherworldly energy as holographic projections fill the chamber with questions that pierce directly to the souls of those present. The Augurbox's voice resonates with the authority of eons, demanding that each person account for their choices, their intentions, and their worthiness to inherit the knowledge it guards. Drifters, Guild members, and faction leaders stand before it with their weapons lowered and their pretenses stripped away, knowing that no deception can hide from its all-seeing analysis. The AI's questions are not accusations but opportunities for awakeningâ€”chances to recognize one's true calling and accept the responsibility that comes with power and knowledge. Ancient symbols dance in the air around the assembled figures, while the Augurbox's judgment takes the form not of punishment but of transformation, calling each person to rise to their highest potential. The scene represents the moment of final reckoning when all illusions fall away, the awakening to one's true purpose, and the divine call to embrace destiny."
