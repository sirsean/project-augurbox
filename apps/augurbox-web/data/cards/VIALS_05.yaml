# Full card description/meaning
prompt: A cloaked figure in a contamination suit contemplates three shattered vials leaking precious bio-fluid into the toxic soil, their valuable contents lost to accident or sabotage, while two intact vials still glow behind them with salvageable resources. In the distance, a bridge of living coral spans a chasm leading to a thriving bio-dome settlement, suggesting that despite the loss of precious materials and broken trade relationships, there remains hope for rebuilding alliances and recovering from resource disasters through persistence and careful cultivation.
