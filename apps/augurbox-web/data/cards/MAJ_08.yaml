# Full card description/meaning
prompt: "A calm Drifter in weathered protective gear kneels beside a massive, agitated alien creature whose bio-luminescent markings pulse with stress and aggression. Rather than using weapons or restraints, the Drifter extends one hand toward the creature while the other holds a small offering of synthesized nutrients. The creature's multiple eyes gradually dim from hostile red to curious amber as it responds to the gentle approach. Around them, the harsh alien landscape seems to quiet, as if nature itself recognizes the power of compassion over force. The scene represents inner strength that tames through understanding rather than domination, the courage to approach danger with empathy, and the wisdom that true power comes from connection rather than control."
