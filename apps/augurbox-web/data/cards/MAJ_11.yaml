# Full card description/meaning
prompt: "Two faction representatives sit across from each other at a reinforced negotiation table while a neutral arbitrator in formal robes holds an ornate scale in one hand and a plasma stylus in the other, ready to seal their agreement with legal authority. The contract itself hovers as a holographic document between them, its terms clearly visible to all parties. Behind each representative stand witnesses and legal advisors, while armed enforcers from both sides maintain watchful positions. The scene occurs in a neutral station with the insignia of interstellar law prominently displayed. The arbitrator's expression shows impartial wisdom, representing the principle that agreements made in good faith must be honored, that actions have consequences, and that justice serves as the foundation upon which civilized society can exist even in the lawless frontier."
