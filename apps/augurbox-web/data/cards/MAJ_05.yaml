# Full card description/meaning
prompt: An ancient storyteller sits before a gathering of Drifters around a crackling energy fire, wearing robes decorated with symbols from dozens of different cultures and civilizations. Holographic fragments of historical records float above their hands as they weave tales of lost colonies, legendary explorers, and the origins of the great diaspora. Their weathered face shows the accumulated wisdom of one who has preserved the cultural memory of scattered humanity, while their audience listens with reverence to stories that connect them to their heritage. The scene represents the preservation of tradition, the guidance found in ancestral wisdom, and the power of shared stories to unite disparate communities.
