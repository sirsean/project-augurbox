# Full card description/meaning
prompt: "A determined pilot guides a heavily-laden cargo vessel through a treacherous asteroid field, their hands steady on manual controls while navigation displays show multiple hazard warnings. The ship's hull bears the scars of previous journeys, but its cargo hold contains essential supplies for a distant outpost. Two escort vessels—one sleek and fast, one heavily armored—flank the hauler, representing the opposing forces of speed and security that must be balanced on every run. The pilot's expression shows absolute focus and determination to deliver their cargo despite the dangers. The scene represents willpower overcoming obstacles, the drive to connect isolated communities, and progress achieved through persistent effort against overwhelming odds."
