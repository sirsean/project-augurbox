# Full card description/meaning
prompt: "A mysterious device of alien origin sits in a darkened chamber, its crystalline surfaces projecting shifting holographic patterns that seem to move and change based on the observer's deepest thoughts and fears. The device feeds on psychic energy, creating elaborate illusions that blend memory, desire, and nightmare into convincing false realities. A lone researcher approaches cautiously, wearing protective neural dampeners, but even through the shielding, the Mesmegraph's influence seeps through, causing the walls of the chamber to ripple like water and familiar faces to emerge from the shadows. The projections show distorted versions of home, lost loved ones, and impossible promises, while also revealing hidden truths about the researcher's own motivations and fears. The scene represents the power of the subconscious mind to both deceive and illuminate, the danger of mistaking desire for reality, and the importance of trusting inner wisdom even when external evidence seems compelling."
