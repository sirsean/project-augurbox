# Full card description/meaning
prompt: "A salvage operator hangs suspended in zero gravity within the twisted wreckage of a massive derelict vessel, their safety line the only thing preventing them from drifting into the void. Rather than showing distress, their expression is one of serene acceptance and heightened awareness. From this inverted perspective, they can see patterns in the wreckage that would be invisible from any other angleâ€”hidden passages, valuable components, and the ship's tragic story written in twisted metal and shattered systems. Their helmet light illuminates ancient symbols and technological mysteries, while their suspended position allows them to understand the vessel's final moments in a way no upright exploration could achieve. The scene represents the wisdom gained through surrender, the new insights that come from accepting vulnerability, and the understanding that sometimes we must let go of control to see the truth."
