# Full card description/meaning
prompt: "A solitary figure in an advanced environmental suit stands atop a high rocky outcrop, holding a glowing sensor array that casts light across the desolate alien landscape below. Their helmet's heads-up display shows resource readings and geological surveys, but their posture suggests deep contemplation beyond mere material concerns. In the distance, the lights of settlements twinkle like distant stars, while above, aurora-like energy patterns dance across the alien sky. The prospector's isolation is not loneliness but chosen solitude, representing the necessary journey inward to understand one's true purpose, the wisdom found in quiet reflection, and the inner guidance that can only be heard away from the noise of civilization."
