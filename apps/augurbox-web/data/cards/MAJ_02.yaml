# Full card description/meaning
prompt: A solitary figure in a modified environmental suit sits in deep meditation aboard a small vessel at the edge of a cosmic anomaly, where reality bends and strange energies swirl in impossible patterns. Ancient star charts and sensor readings float around them, but their eyes are closed in communion with forces beyond technological measurement. The anomaly pulses with colors that have no names, and fragments of alien geometries drift past the viewport. The scene represents intuitive knowledge that transcends instruments, the ability to sense cosmic currents and dimensional shifts, and the wisdom found in embracing the mystery of the unknown void.
